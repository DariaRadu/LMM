# A Case Study on Basic and Learned Motion Matching

This project represents the experiment on implementing Basic and Learned Motion Matching in Unity. The full details of the project and process can be found in the final report [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NjRFpslNz_ZlIwFojS5I7baIuxL9N8mpXnj85bVDqKw/edit?usp=sharing)
This project uses the [Ubisoft LaForge Animation Dataset.](https://github.com/ubisoft/Ubisoft-LaForge-Animation-Dataset)

**OBS:** The code for this project is only displayed on Github for viewing purposes, the setup for running it locally is complicated and it needs samples from the animation dataset. If you want to see a demo, you can freely contact me directly.
In addition, this code should not be reused, as it represents the intellectual property of more people.
